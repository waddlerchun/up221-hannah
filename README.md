## Introduction
My name is Hannah Chun, and this is my first year in the MURP program. My concentration is environmental analysis and policy, and I am specifically interested in learning about how communities can adapt to extreme heat and drought. My background is in civil and environmental engineering. I seek to approach climate-related issues from an engineering and social justice lens. 

## Course Description
Students will gain a basic understanding of Python-based spatial data science, and how to apply it to visualize urban issues. 

## Course Objectives
- Learn the basic principles of data science
- Learn the basics of the programming language Python
- Use GIS to create and analyze meaningful maps that broaden the understanding of issues related to urban planning

## Project Ideas
- Map flood-risk areas along with green spaces to suggest areas where green spaces should be expanded in the City of Los Angeles
- Climate change analysis: Map the areas in LA that have experienced the greatest changes in temperature, air quality, drought, etc.
- Identify the demographics that reside in areas that are most at risk for experiencing the effects of climate change
